Programming for Artificial Intelligence: Data Processing and Analysis
Project Overview
================
This project demonstrates various programming techniques in Python, focusing on data retrieval, processing, and statistical analysis. It is divided into four main modules:
NASA APOD Data Retrieval and Processing: Fetching Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) data from NASA's API.
Iris Dataset Analysis: Performing data analysis and visualization on the Iris dataset.
Numpy Array Manipulation: Statistical computations and conditional array transformations.
JSON Reading and Analysis: Reading JSON files, processing their content, and exporting results to CSV.
Files Description
The project consists of the following files:
- `nasa_apod.py`: Retrieves APOD data from NASA's API and processes it
- `iris_analysis.py`: Analyzes the Iris dataset
- `numpy_array_manipulation.py`: Demonstrates statistical computations and conditional array transformations
- `json_reading_analysis.py`: Reads JSON files, processes their content, and exports results to CSV
python
# nasa_apod.py

Purpose: Fetch data from NASA's APOD API for a specified date range and store it in apod_results.json.
Key Functions:
get_apod_info(api_key, date): Fetches APOD data for a specific date.
get_apod_data(api_key, s_date, e_date): Iterates through a date range to retrieve and store data.
Usage:
Specify the date range in s_date and e_date.
Run the script to save data in JSON format.
Output: A JSON file (apod_results.json) containing APOD data.
python
